# generator-primate-skeleton

Skeleton front-end file structure

## Current status

Very early edition of the Yeoman generator which will be used to deliver starter files for Primate front-end builds.

The Generator isn't currently linked via NPM, so when you want to work with it locally, you need to link it locally.  To do so, run the following shell command in the route of the repository: ```npm link```

You can then ask Yeoman to generate using this generate.  You would run the following shell command ```yo primate-skeleton```
